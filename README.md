# Yu-Gi-Oh! TIMELESS

This repostiry provides a beginner-friendly command line tool for creating
pairings for a TIMELESS tournament.

> TIMELESS is a custom 4-player tournament format for the Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading
> Card Game. A TIMELESS tournament consists of four rounds. The three
> preliminary rounds, in which each duelist faces off against every other
> duelist, are followed up by a final play-off round. In each round, decks
> from a carefully constructed deck set of four are randomly assigned to the
> duelists. This is done in such a way that during the course of the tournament
> each duelist pilots each of the decks exactly once.
